In this experiment, we have designed a specific workload for benchmarking a HDFS system built using commodity machines. We have also presented the rationale behind the pattern of system response time observed during the experiment as we changed the size of the cluster. Based on the experimental results obtained, we have used graphical analysis to predict the expected response time for larger data sets. As an illustration, we have presented the graphs generated by Ganglia depicting some of the performance metrics of the HDFS cluster during a particular run of the experiment.

In future, we plan to expand the size of the cluster furthermore and work on developing a graphical analysis to predict the optimum size of cluster required to work with data of a particular size. Also, we intend to make an open source release of the customized benchmarking suite used in the experiment available to the Big Data community.
